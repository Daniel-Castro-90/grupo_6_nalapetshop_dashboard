# Dashboard for Nala PetShop

## Description:
- An admin panel used to manage and supervise the products offered at Nala Pet Shop. This Dashboard features functions to add, modify, and/or delete products and users. Additionally, users can be registered as Administrators to grant them access to the Dashboard. Another standout feature of this project is real-time statistics related to products and user choices when purchasing them. Within the statistics, users can find: the last added product, the most requested product of the mont, a ranking of the most used payment methods, a ranking of the most requested shipping methods by buyers, the number of registered users, and the number of products loaded.


## Guidance
- Target audience: store owners, businesses, or entrepreneurs who require statistics to boost their sales and offer a better product, as well as having the convenience of managing their ecommerce from any internet-connected point.
